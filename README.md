# Charitas-Protocol
Charitas Token Contract

Charitas protocol provides static rewards auto-distributed to token holders with automatic liquidity pool provisioning. No minting after deployment and manual burn from liquidity pool at predictable rate and after charitable donations take place. Initial balance sent directly to DxSale for fair launch. Dev tokens locked for time-based, development-based and market cap based milestones. DxSale protocol allows auto-locking of liquidity for 4 years. Full transparency, mega-marketing and predictable burn allows positive price action thanks to tokenomics. Community-run and governance application for charities incoming. #charitas-protocol
